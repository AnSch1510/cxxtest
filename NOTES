4.0 Release Checklist
---------------------

. Update LGPL documentation in source cxxtest source files in the python and cxxtest subdirectories.

. Update Sandia copyright documentation in source files as well.

. Change FOG parser to put temporary parsetab.py files someplace other than the current directory.
    Q: Can we assume that the user will have write-access to the cxxtest root directory?  I would
        guess NO.

. Documentation
.. Finalize discussion of global and world fixtures.
.. Finalize discussion of value traits
.. Add generation of PDF and Epub formats
.. Resolve formatting issues
.. Remove the docs subdirectory

. Upload documentation to SourceForge
    Q: Can we do this?  I don't think any of the active developers are administrators on that project.

. Evaluate status of the build_tools
    Q: Is anyone using this actively?  If so, who will update the documentation?

. Delete the bin/get_revision_from_cvs.pl script
    Q: We're not using this, right?

. Figure out what to do with cxxtest.spec
    Q: What is this for?  Mac Ports?

. Cleanup resolved tickets

. Resolve CxxTest project planning concerns
    Note: this doesn't directly affect the release process, but I think it affects the timing
    and planning of the release.

. Add a test harness for the doc/examples directory.
    Note: the easy way to do this would be to perform file diffs
    against the baseline files I've setup, using the PyUtilib test
    harness logic that I've developed.  But, I'm reluctant to make
    these tests depend on another package.  Hmmm...
