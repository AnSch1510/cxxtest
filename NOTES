4.0 Release Checklist
---------------------

. Update LGPL documentation in source cxxtest source files in the python and cxxtest subdirectories.

. Update Sandia copyright documentation in source files as well.

. Change FOG parser to put temporary parsetab.py files someplace other than the current directory.
    Q: Can we assume that the user will have write-access to the cxxtest root directory?  I would
        guess NO, so perhaps this is a ticket for 4.1

. Add a CMAKE build harness
    This is a 4.1 ticket

. Add valgrind tests
    This is a 4.1 ticket

. Upload documentation to SourceForge
    Q: Can we do this?  I don't think any of the active developers are administrators on that project.

. Evaluate status of the build_tools
    Gasper will update the guide.txt file with documentation for SCons

. Remove the www directory after moving from tigris
    Bill will do this

. Cleanup resolved tickets

. Resolve CxxTest project planning concerns
    Note: this doesn't directly affect the release process, but I think it affects the timing
    and planning of the release.
