We are pleased to announce the updated release of CxxTest 4.1.
CxxTest is a unit testing framework for C++ that is similar in
spirit to JUnit, CppUnit, and xUnit. CxxTest is easy to use because
it does not require precompiling a CxxTest testing library, it
employs no advanced features of C++ (e.g. RTTI) and it supports a
very flexible form of test discovery.

This release resolves the following issues:

 * Added absolute paths to resolve bug when relative path links are provided.
 * Bug fix when files contain unicode characters
 * Fix for --no-static-init:  Changed how non-static tests are created
 * Updated user guide to include SCons build system
 * Closing out Tigris and SourceForge tickets
 * Added valgrind tests.

See the CxxTest Home Page (http://cxxtest.com) for documentation
and download instructions.

Enjoy!
